## Ryan's Advice

You may hear that MinGW or Cygwin shouldn't be used for this course.
This is very important.
Your code has a good chance of not working if you use those tools.

Ryan advises using Linux.
WSL may not work well enough so it is a good idea to either dual boot linux or install a virtual machine.

Ryan suggests learning common Linux shells as soon as you can.
Ryan suggests reading the [Linux Command Line book](https://www.linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php).

Ryan suggests to use the `info` pages as well as the `man` pages.
The difference is `man` pages are manual pages, they are highly technical.
The `info` pages are designed to be more user friendly and walk the reader through best practices.

## Timeline for UWindsor Awards

The Student Awards & Financial Aid Office has provided a [summary](https://www.uwindsor.ca/studentawards/431/financial-aid-steps) of financial aid steps and timelines of which you can take reference from.

### Current Undergraduate Students

For current undergraduate students, the typical timeline for UWinAward applications are as follows:

| Term          | Application Availability        | Application Deadline      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Fall-Only     | Aug 1 of the prior Summer term  | Oct 15 of the Fall term   |
| Fall & Winter | Aug 1 of the prior Summer term  | Oct 15 of the Fall term   |
| Winter-Only   | Aug 1 of the prior Summer term  | Jan 15 of the Winter term |
| Summer        | Apr 15 of the prior Winter term | Jun 30 of the Summer term |

Certain awards may have an earlier or later deadline, and the general timeline may differ between years, so make sure to check the [Student Awards & Financial Aid Office website](https://www.uwindsor.ca/studentawards/) and the UWinAward Profile regularly for updates.

Although award applications can still be submitted after the deadline, we encourage you to apply as early as possible. Please note that this timeline does not include the application deadline for student-group awards, which will differ between groups.

:::caution
For general need-based awards, you will also need to apply for OSAP (or other government financial aid application as directed by the Student Awards & Financial Aid Office) to be considered for the particular term(s).
:::

### Prospective Students

For incoming/prospective students, the UWinAward Profile typically opens on December 1st of your Grade 12 year and is due April 30th of the intake year. Certain awards, though, may open their application as early as Nov 1st and require applications.

:::caution
While the University of Windsor will honor deferral of open entrance scholarships with some conditions, other entrance awards may not be deferrable. In such scenarios, you will need to re-apply for these awards.

## How to Apply for Awards

Log into [UWinsite Student][uwinsite] and complete the Award Profile. The University has provided a [how-to guide][guide] to assist you. Once you have completed your Award Profile, you can apply to the awards of your choice. See [Finding Awards](finding-awards) to find out how to search for awards, as well as some notable awards to apply to.

## How to Maintain Awards

Most awards or scholarships are one-time awards (i.e. disbursed in full amount for one time). However, certain awards such as entrance scholarships will disburse in consistent amounts throughout your undergraduate studies. Typically, one of the requirements for maintaining/renewing these awards is to maintain a certain level of cumulative GPA.

In the case of entrance scholarships, students must register as full-time students (60% or more of a full course load for domestic students, 80% or more for international students) for 2 semesters within an academic year. Additionally, you will need to maintain a scholarship average of 85% or more at the end of each 2-terms.

Although the scholarship average is equivalent to the cumulative GPA in past years, recent policies changed the calculation of scholarship average to the following table. For detailed information, please contact the [Student Awards & Financial Aid Office](https://www.uwindsor.ca/studentawards/304/office-location-and-hours) and check their website for [updated policies](https://www.uwindsor.ca/studentawards/sites/uwindsor.ca.studentawards/files/2022-2023_entrance_award_regulations_2.pdf) for each academic year.

| Year | Scholarship Average                                         |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Top 6 12O U or M grades used to calculate admission average |
| 2    | Top 6 courses from semester 1-2                             |
| 3    | Top 12 courses from semester 1-4                            |
| 4    | Top 18 courses from semester 1-6                            |

## What other kinds of financial aids are there?

Other than applying for awards, scholarships and bursaries from the University of Windsor and affiliated student groups, you can also apply for external scholarships from websites, community organizations, and you or your relatives' employers.

If you are experiencing financial hardships, you can also follow the steps outlined by the Student Awards & Financial Aid Office for [Financial Hardship Assistance](https://www.uwindsor.ca/studentawards/455/financial-hardship-assistance) and contact them through ask.uwindsor.ca for additional assistance.

Additionally, the University of Windsor provides employment opportunities throughout the academic year in forms of assistantships (teaching assistants, research assistants, residence assistants) and student [work-study programs](https://www.uwindsor.ca/career-development-experiential/ignite).

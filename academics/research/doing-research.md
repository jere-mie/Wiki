## Is Research Right for You?

If you plan to do graduate studies, research is the best way to get you started. It will give you helpful insight into how research study works, and you will build a good relationship with different faculty members who will help you when you apply for grad school. Conversely, research is a great way to let you know whether if you want to pursue graduate studies.

Doing research requires a lot of independent reading and studying on the subject of your research. You will need to work with data and models. In addition, you will need to apply your knowledge and critically analyze your research to investigate a question that does not have any "right" answer. If you feel like that you enjoy doing these things, then research may be the right path for you.

It is okay to not be completely sure if you want to do research or not: going to University _is_ the chance to explore your interests and passions. If you feel that you like the idea of continuing graduate studies or if you feel like you'd be interested in research work, then you absolutely should look for research opportunities.

However, if those ideas don't appeal to you, then Co-op/Internship may be a better path. You will gain different practical skills and experience that will help you.

## Ways To Get Involved With Research

The University has a program called Outstanding Scholars where students from all faculties can get involved in research projects.

Sometimes, professors will also post research opportunities on Ignite (MySuccess) or in your student community.

As well, many professors will showcase their research during fairs, Meet the Prof Nights, and other events. You can always talk to professors whose research interests you: they may be looking for more volunteers/research assistants.
